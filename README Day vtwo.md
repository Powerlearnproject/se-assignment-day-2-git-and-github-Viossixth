## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
The fundamental concept of version control systems is to enable the software engineer to track changes to their code over time, enabling them to make revisions and reverting back to earlier revisions easily.Github is a popular tool because it's a cloud base platform where code can be stored, shared for collaboration with others and reviewed. It simplifies the creation of code, and gives good accessibility as it is cloud based. Version control helps to maintain project intergrity because the changes made, on which lines,when and by who can be traced easily allowing proper auditing of the code.

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
To create a new repository on Github, you need to log into Github using your login credentials. If a user does'nt have them, they can sign up using their email address.To proceed, click the plus icon on top left, and choose new repository. On the following page, chose a name for the repository and change any settings if needed. Scroll down the page and click create a new repository.

## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
A README file is a starting point in any repository. It can be used as an introduction to tell others how to use the repository, what the function for the repository is for and instruction the creator of the repository wants to share.

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
Public repositories are accessible to anyone on the internet whilst private repositories are only accesible to the people you give permission to. Private repositories may also be hidden, not visible to the public but to certain people and internally from an organization should the option be chosen.

## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
Commits, are recordings of the changed code. Every successful commit is visible when you check the version history of the repository and can check the changes made. On VS Code (desktop) you navigate to the Source control tab on the left, and search for the commit button. Click commit and wait until the system notifies if you're attempt was successful.

## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
Branching allows the software engineer to create a parallel line of code, separate from the main code. It allows the engineer to change, fix or debug the code separately without changing the main code and  intergrate the code back. The process entails cloning the repository, creating a feature branch, making changes and commit, a pull request and code review.

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
A pull request allows for a set of changes on one branch to be implemented on another branch, most likely the main branch. These allow collaboration as one person can code the branch and imtergrate it to the main branch. One person can focus on smaller portions whilst the other focuses on the next portion.

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
Forking is creating a copy of a repository that exists on Github and allows you to make changes without impacting the local repository. You don't have direct collaboration but can contribute to the direct project by pull requests. Cloning is creating a local save on your desktop which can be synced with the remote to Github. Cloning is directly contribution to the project utilising branching. Forking is useful when the root repository works as the basis of a project, and intended for further iteration or is the main creative idea.

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.
Issues are used to plan,discuss and track work. Issues allows a team to track bug reports, new features, ideas and any topic of discussion. They are a medium for collaboration intended to communicate any key features among a team.

## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
New users might not understanding certain concepts and tool familiarity. New users might need training on the tools, need to be read on concepts they will have to work with on Github. A good practice to have is to encourage fewer commits as a team, to set standards as to when commits can be commited and that the build should pass the unit test before commiting.
